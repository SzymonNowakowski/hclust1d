# This is the first resubmission of 0.1.0

I limited the extent of unit tests to make it pass the precheck  rhub and win-devel checks

# Local checks

## local R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs. 

## Downstream dependencies
There seem to be no downstream dependencies:

```{r revdep}
devtools::revdep("hclust1d")
# character(0)
```
